    "Nowadays, the role of the sharing economy in tourism is increasing, and the number of people involved as guests or hosts is rising day by day. This dynamic generates a viable alternative to the traditional services, allowing tourists to customize their trips and enrich their experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Airbnb began as a way for travellers to find unique, local experiences and accommodations, and for hosts to earn extra income by renting out spare rooms, apartments, or entire homes. Over time, it has expanded to include a wide range of options—from urban apartments and rural cabins to luxury villas and even treehouses—offering travellers diverse ways to stay and explore around the world.\n",
    "Airbnb operates on a sharing economy model, where hosts can monetize their property by listing it on the platform. The platform is accessible via the Airbnb website or mobile app, enabling both hosts and guests to manage bookings, communicate, and leave reviews."

The rsample package will help us for this task. We will use initial_split() to randomly split our dataset, with 80% for training use. We will use the training() and testing() functions to extract the training and testing data respectively. \n",

    "We will only use the training dataset here. We have 16 variables in our dataset that could be possible predictors of Airbnb listing price. We can use statistical variable selection process to determine which factors may be most useful in predicting our response. We can decide between subset selection methods (stepAIC() and regsubset()) and regularization methods (LASSO and Ridge). Regularization accounts for model complexity to better protect against overfitting, thus making it more applicable for predictive uses. Since LASSO is able to zero-out coefficients, we will use it to decide which variables are not included in the model.\n",

    "### Evaluate Results:\n",
    "With our actual and predicted values, we can calculate the root-mean squared error using rmse() (from mltools) and examine its magnitude. A lower RMSE indicates that our model is good at predicting realSum values. We can use plot() with our predicted and actual values as a visual aid of our model's performance. We can evaluate the simplicity of our model by seeing how many variables are use as predictors compared to the total number of variables in the dataset. Finally, we will create a plot of our residuals (plot()) and a QQplot (qqnorm()) to ensure our assumptions for a linear model aren't violated. "

    "\n",
    "Our analysis has many assumptions, and if any turn out to be false our results may be invalid or require further correction. For instance, the relationship between the predictors and realSum may not be strictly linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is an external observational study, we cannot easily discover or isolate possible confounders from the data. \n",
    "There may also be hidden *interactions* or other important predictors that were overlooked or excluded from the dataset. For instance, the data used was collected over one summer, and thus does not consider the season. Other important variables could be the amenities, neighbourhood crime rate, and more. We note the risk of overfitting when including more predictors and interactive terms in a model.\n",
    "In particular, only looking at the data for Rome, Budapest and London could result in *Simpson’s paradox*, where the apparent associations for these three cities are not observed in other cities, or as a whole in Europe. These factors may result in higher or lower model performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Future studies could examine the long-term trends in Airbnb price with Time Series analyses, consider more variables and interactions such as the season. It may also be a good idea to analyze on a per-city basis, as well as the trends for different groups of cities, or the trends for other continents and countries.\n"
