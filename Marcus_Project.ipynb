    "## 4) Methods and Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer my question, “*Is there an association between Airbnb prices to the distance to the closest metro and if the listing is for weekends?*“, I will use an additive MLR model using `lm()`, with the formula: `realSum ~ metro_dist + isWeekend`. This method is appropriate, because `lm()` allows us to quantify and test the significance of associations, with interpretable coefficients. Through hypothesis testing, we will either have evidence suggesting statistically significant associations (a p-value less than a chosen significance level for that coefficient), or not enough evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we need to make the following assumptions:\n",
    "- Linearity: There is a linear relationship between `realSum` and `metro_dist`.\n",
    "- Independence: The errors (observations) are independent of each other.\n",
    "- Normality: Under the CLT, since our data contains 23042 observations, the data and errors in the data are assumed to be normally distributed.\n",
    "- Homoscedasticity: The errors have constant variance.\n",
    "- There is no interaction between `metro_dist` and `isWeekend` on Airbnb prices. That is, the estimated change in Airbnb price for every change in distance to the metro does not differ depending on if the listing is on a weekend or not.\n",
    "- The covariates are not highly correlated (multicollinearity)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also the following limitations:\n",
    "- Incorrect Assumptions: If some of our assumptions turn out to be false, then our results may be invalid or require corrections. For instance, if the relationship is non-linear, we may need to transform some covariates.\n",
    "- Confounding: Since the model only includes two variables, there may be other variables that influence both price and metro distance (ie. city). This could result in biased estimates, if not included in the model.\n",
    "- Outliers: Based on the EDA, the data is skewed with outliers, which may result in a model that does not capture representative patterns.\n"
